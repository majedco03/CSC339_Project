# In this file, you will implement the initial UI that collects
# all required NFA parameters from the user, The inputs should include:
#
# - alphabet: list of characters 
# - number_of_states: integer representing the total number of states
# - start_states: list of integers (NFA may have multiple start states)
# - final_states: list of integers
# - transitions: dictionary where:
#                  key   = (from_state, symbol)
#                  value = list of to_states (NFA supports multiple transitions)
#
# After gathering all the inputs, pass these parameters to the
# NFASimulation.py file 
#
# easist wat to implement the GUI is TKinter
